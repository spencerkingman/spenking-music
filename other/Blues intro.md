Wind sure   kicked up in the last hour or so
Just as re- entry was close we came tumbling down
F C F
Like a falling star o    ver New Mexico

Bm G A F#
They snowed the crashing at Corona
G A
Threatened the teletype photographed our bodies
Bm G A F#
They sold the crashing at Corona
G Em7 D
As a radar reflector flew us out to Albuquerque

Brass came to the Great Plains with their armored cars jeeps and junk
Took great pains with the remains till they all were inside the crates and trunks
Then the freight was lifted into the bombers' haul

They snowed the crashing at Corona
Interrupted the wire concealed debris
They snowed the crashing at Corona
Said a weather balloon went down out of White Sands Trinity

F Em7 D

Rains came plugged the storm drains shame while the 509th bomb grew
Rocket wrecks wind the Bolex days of space age what lie next
Verification of the Kodak test

They snowed the crashing at Corona
Interrupted the wire concealed debris
They snowed the crashing at Corona
Said a weather balloon went down out of White Sands Trinity

Flew us out to Albuquerque
Flew us out to Albuquerque
Flew us out to Albuquerque
White Sands Trinity
