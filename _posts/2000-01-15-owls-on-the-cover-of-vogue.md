owls on the cover of Vogue / that's how their faces looked  
when the story broke / it made the paper stink  
you can't trap a skunk  / in it's coat  
  
a trial's on the tv news / and maybe nothing else  
but no sacred clues / cut up the stolid ground  
to beam up and down  / wild avenues  
  
pebbles under neon sand / to chase a progress back   
hot metal crayon / distorted color crack  
burr scatter mark / on the bark  
  
but I don't want to be this dark / or spread bubonic plague  
before the panics start / to eat my arm and leg  
mad nervous rage / I know my age to the day  
   
a flower in the ruler's hair / who scared the horses off?  
won't soften blows / Iâ€™m only throwing shoes  
stop blowing holes in the roof  
  
I don't need a secret proof  
of the famous truth  
when blood in my ear  
is all I can hear
