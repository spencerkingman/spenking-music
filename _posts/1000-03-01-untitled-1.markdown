(capo: 5)

What do I have to win  
In the window that I'm in?  
Picture and pretend,  
Or the matter to contend?

Someone send me somewhere  
Lead me not astray  
Not too long ago  
Not too far away

Whisper who you are  
Light a candle in my ear  
Armored wall-on-wall  
Are you anything at all?

Flattened out on the floor  
Like a hand against the wind  
Traveling black in time  
Fatalistic to no end

What do I have to win  
In the window that I'm in?  
Picture and pretend,  
Or the matter to contend?
