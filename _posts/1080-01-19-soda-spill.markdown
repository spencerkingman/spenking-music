(capo: 8)

trail-blaze all the parking lot's monumental signage  
with the breath you carried here underneath your tongue  
conquered silent, concrete island   
big flourescent words  
buzz me in to see you  
  
ooze out of your sense of self, frying on the blacktop  
lose your nose in traffic holes; cross against the red  
buried mountain, corner fountain   
soda spill machine  
and this, my only dollar  
  
this my only dollar bill shall not leave me wasted  
rolled up on the tower steps like some peeling orange  
arts & culture, dish-wash, chauffeur   
it’s written on the windex:  
Siegfried got a raw deal  
  
sprinklers make their move at night, cooling off the phantoms  
hop the wall and duck them all, stucco on my chin  
never leave your A/C halo  
hanging, muggers row  
valley’s in the nineties  
  
spill-proof carpet, shapeshift glass, inside-out apartment  
place your hand in someone’s pool, let them pull through you  
charcoal, sand art, vacuum, landmark  
planes keep shoveling in  
nowhere, any people
