(by Shakespeare, Rufus Wainwright)

`E Eaug F Faug x2`

`E Eaug F Faug C#dim`
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
`E Eaug F Faug D5b/F#`
For all the day they view things unrespected
`E Eaug F Faug C#dim`
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
`E Eaug F Faug D5b/F#`
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed

`E Eaug F Faug x2`

`E Eaug Asus4 Amaj7 C#m7add9 (x46444) C#m7/D (056450) B7sus4/E (042400) E`
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
`Eaug F Fmaj7 E Bm E Eaug`
How would thy shadow's form form happy show
`Bm E`
`E Eaug Asus4 Amaj7 C#m7add9 (x46444) C#m7/D (056450) A E`
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
`Bm E Eaug F Faug E Eaug F Faug`
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
`Bm E Eaug F Faug E Eaug F Faug`
[too-doo-doo-doo]

How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
 
`E Eaug F Faug`
`E Eaug E Eaug x2`

`Bm E x4`
All days are nights to see till I see thee
`A Am E Gdim F#m Bb E Eaug F Faug E` 
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
