And I'm such a lousy soldier  
_bowser bowser bow_  
Cause I can't remember orders  
_bowser bowser bow_  
Help me count the lonely hours  
_bowser bowser bow_  
As I sleep away my powers  
_bowser bowser bow_  

_bowser bowser bowser bow bo ow oh_  
_bowser bowser bo bow oh ow, out now_

Recollect the mighty falcon  
_bowser bowser bow_  
As it strides atop the mountain  
_bowser bowser bow_  
And surveys the lowly forest  
_bowser bowser bow_  
As it stretches out before us  
_bowser bowser bow_  

_bowser bowser bowser bow bo ow oh_  
_bowser bowser bo bow oh ow, out now_
