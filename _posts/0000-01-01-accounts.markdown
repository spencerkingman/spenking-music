Drowned in a soaking hold  
I told you to remember  
The code where your at  

It was caught in locked accounts  
It's locked in poison bread  
Ignore the things I said  
I was speaking for the dead  

Laid in the grass to dry  
With cuts all down my arms  
light a little fire  

Brendon's got the flood  
He's sopping up the mud  
Dropping balls of sweat  
Onto the floor so wet  

He was trapped in frozen ice  
Breathing through his eyes  
A hundred thousand lives  

But now he's out for good  
He's scavenging bits of food  
That stick inside his beard  
He's everything we feared
