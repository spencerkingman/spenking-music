(capo: 1)

midnight carrier  
breast-warm burier  
untrained melody  
new identity  
merrily, merrily grow  

to a tip-toe step  
and asleep on a breath  

another move on the earth to fall in love with the air  
another word and a voice to call it up from anywhere  
a little girl  

you’re only one away, one away   
make a bed  
here in the meadow-line of my arm  
tuck a head  

nite-lite water  
move waist high; Daughter, I  
crash test challenges  
weights and balances  

like a midnight carrier  
across word barrier  
oddball reverence  
you’ve got evidence  
haven’t you, haven’t you?  

in your finespun hair  
go to sleep on a chair  

another earth on the move to fall in love with the air  
another word and a song to call upon me anywhere  
so here we go  

you’re only one away, one away   
make a bed  
here in the melonrind of my arm  
tuck a head  

you’re gonna be alive, be alive  
let it be a while  
how many, many nights, you and I?  
many, many, my…
