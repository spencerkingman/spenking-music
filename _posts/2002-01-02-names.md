(by Weak Signal)

`C D A`  
`C D A`  
`C D A`  
`C G A`
I know the names of those who should be named  
I know the names of those who won't be named  
I know the names of those who should be here  
And I know the ones who disappeared  

I know the names of those who're after me  
I know the name of those that I can't see  
I know the names of those who put me here  
And I know the ones who disappeared  

I know the names of all the evil ones  
Who hide behind the faces of the favorite sons  
I know the names of all the hidden ones  
And I am as schizo as them come
