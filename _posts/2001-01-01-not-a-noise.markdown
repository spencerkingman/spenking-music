(capo 3)

`F Em(b9)`  
Not a noise, not a song  
`F Emb9 Dm`  
Not a light, not a long October  
`C Em`  
Take me over  
`C Em`  
`F(b5) G9`  
What was true in the thaw  
`Am9 G`  
was a lie you just thought  
`F`  
you saw closer  
`C Em`  
Take me over  
`C Em`  
`F G`  
I’ve been down in the claw  
`Am G`  
for a sign that got lost  
`F C`  
Four leaf clover, take me over

`C Cm`  
Sun is red  
`C Cm`  
Cut my lips  
`C Cm`  
The sum is death  
`C Cm`  
Ticks and tricks  
`F`  
The sum is red  
`G`  
Sunday roll  
`C Cm`  
O my soul  
`C Cm`  
`F G`  
What was real as a thought  
`Am G`  
is a face in the frost  
`F`  
You don’t know her  
`C Em`  
Take me over  
`C Em`
