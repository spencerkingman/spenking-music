You were the first in a long line  
All of our sentimental hearts traced back in time  
Bow to the light that was over my head in the sick bed  
And the girls was right there over my head, resurrected  
Ooh with a god that knows like a needle and thread where the fingers go  
Dangling his legs all night there over my head in the black lights  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I can't really seem to erase that memory  
I can't really seem to escape that part of me  
Take these please sleep through the whole thing like a sparrow  
Cause your blood might drip from the poisonous tip of an arrow  
Ooh while the doctors slap at the venomous gnats that attack me  
Oh and i thank god, white guaze over my eyes,  
That I can't see anything  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
This is the end of the Kingman line  
Cut off at the heart where the blood stopped time  
Take great care to color your hair for the vampires  
Ooh with amazing grace, paint your face for the empire  
Ooh when it calls you out, everyone shout for the cub scouts  
Ooh and i can't remember what i just said on my deathbed  

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
