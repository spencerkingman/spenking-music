Will you love me as I am? / take on me like a birdie in the hand / Will you sing me like a song? / Tune me into the melody you carry along / inside of you / Will you wind my line 'round yr book of had days? /
I'm curling out like a spiral here and there on the page / The dog with the mannish face / can bury me / like a capsule lapsing time / and I'll grow / heaven know / like a rose

Find a stud in the wall, and I'll hang us a painting that'll never fall / a color to your magic eye / a'hanging / over and over / the breath of the bleeding sun / over and over / the mountains of megaton / over and over / the spread of the day and night / over and over and over / To reckon with the recondite

Will you twirl me in your hands? / Our fires shrink as the universe expands / But will you find your way by feel? / See me into the parts that you see fit to reveal / or vanish in! / When we find ourselves in a zombie cave / I'll screw my eyes to immobilize my face / in the dark / a gather of lifeless weight / re-animate! / re-animate all the damn time / and I do / heaven knew / how do you?

Find a stud in the wall, and I'll hang us a painting that'll never fall / a color to your magic eye / a'hanging / over and over / the breath of the bleeding sun / over and over / the mountains and megatons / over and over / the spread of the day and night / over and over and over / to reckon with the recondite

Hey, I know it's a lot to be breaking the elements down in a fire, but heretofore, I've been too cocky-eyed / To cool the jet of a springs forth eternal or telestrate the fissions bestirred

Will you? Will you? Will you?
