(capo: 5)  
  
What do I have to win  
In the window that I'm in?  
Picture and pretend,  
Or the matter to contend?  
  
Someone send me somewhere  
Lead me not astray  
Not too long ago   
Not too far away  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

Whisper who you are  
Light a candle in my ear  
Thread by hanging wall  
Am I anything at all?  
  
Laid all across the floor  
Like a hand against the wind  
Traveling blackened time  
Hunkered to no end  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

It's hard to not have this dance  
While our love is in the air
Filling the great expanse  
Brimming every moment spare  
  
If I am your someone  
Tell me how can this be then done?  
If you're someone's two  
How can this be then done to you?  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

Scaling the wall of life  
Here, a meaning to inscribe  
Read it from your age  
If a miracle survive  
  
Cup that runs away
Tessellation on the land  
Obsoleted map  
And I don't know where I am  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

Spirited as they come  
But at a loss for what to be  
Conspirators of remorse  
Tower over all I see  
  
Life is off in hiding  
Death is on parade  
Hunker down in his shadow  
Live between his blades  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

What do I have to lose  
In the window that you choose 
Everything I know,  
All above and all below  
  
Someone send me somewhere  
Sing me through the fray  
Not the song I know  
Not the one I play
