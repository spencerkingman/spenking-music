hard to relate my whole life  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">in a ball of phrases</span>  
hard to relate all i want   
<span style="padding-left:1em;">through a hole in my hand</span>  
hard to relate to these gods   
<span style="padding-left:1em;">with their sort-of faces</span>  
hard to relate, heart-to-heart  
  
deepest apologies  
i don't know how to even talk  

the animal has the benefit  
of an instinct to be in-sync  
but I only burn out the filament  
of a tin drum   
and a blue streak  
on a canvas with no tooth  
  
is it gone out of me  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">the stupidity and the grief?</span>  
clear away the debris  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">smuggle in the expansive sympathy</span>  
come a gift, come a theft  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">ill wind, out of breath</span>  
  
it's hard to relate   
<span style="padding-left:1em;">to celebrity demon-angels</span>  
it's hard to relate   
<span style="padding-left:1em;">to the mountains of Afghanistan</span>   
it's hard to relate  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">to a tempest of new diseases</span>    
hard to relate, far too hard  
  
keep your apologies  
you don't know how to fend it off  
no matter what you do  
  
I'm dug in deep underneath  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">the lucidity of the grief</span>  
dug in year-over-year  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">buzz a fly in the face of every fear</span>   
come a gift, come a theft  
<span style="padding-left:1em;">ill wind, out of breath</span>   
  
come to yer senses or nought  
come to yer senses or nought  
come to yer senses or nought  
come to yer senses or nought
