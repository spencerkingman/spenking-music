hard to relate my whole life  
in a ball of phrases.  
hard to relate what i want   
through a hole in my hand.  
hard to relate to these gods   
with their subtle faces.  
hard to relate, heart-to-heart.  
  
deepest apologies  
i don't know how to pull it off  

the animal has the benefit  
of an instinct to be in-sync  
but I only burn the element  
of a tin drum   
and a blue streak  
on a canvas with no tooth  
  
there's a tunnel beneath  
the stupidity of my grief  
I smuggle out the debris  
smuggle in the expansive symphony  
become a gift, become a theft  
ill wind, out of breath  
  
hard to relate   
to celebrity demon angels  
hard to relate   
to the mountains of Afghanistan   
hard to relate  
to these cancers and new diseases    
hard to relate, far too hard  
  
keep yer apologies  
you don't know how to turn it off  
no matter what you do  
  
I'm dug in deep underneath  
the acidity of my grief  
I'm dug in year-over-year  
buzz a fly in the face of every fear   
not a gift, not a theft  
ill wind, out of breath   
  
come to yer senses or nought  
come to yer senses or nought  
come to yer senses or nought  
come to yer senses or nought
