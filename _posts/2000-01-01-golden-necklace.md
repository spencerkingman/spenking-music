(capo: 8)

Pick any bone of contention  
The chicken's split into two sides  
Every wish that I make now  
Feels like gambling in disguise  
I only talk on the pay phone  
There's useless quarters in my shoe  
Are you addicted to bullshit?  
Oh ho ho, me too

Maybe you can kick the habit cold  
I'll just be here  
Chasing bones and lights  
Till I walk through a needle's eye  
Or hole up in the hay of high ideals

To see if I can't wake up  
From this graceless, burning slumber.  
The number on my baseball card  
Is not a baseball number.

Its a Marianas Trench  
A tub-o-lard in a sea of pitch  
Angels in the outhouse with the moon door

Where mares eat oats, and does eat oats,  
And little lambs eat ivy  
Everyone's so scared to hear your prayers  
But why should I be?

Me, alone in my old heart  
Too, alive, but the scattered parts  
Can never seem to manifest whole hog

To gather up a life amess  
And braid a golden necklace.  
To turn my nose at childish things  
And braid the golden necklace

Should a feast fall in our vats?  
Go to town in the butterfat  
I'll forage in the forest for a salt lick

Where every song is a love song  
A "you and me" or "me and I"  
Every show is a cop show  
A Law and Order, CSI  
Every turn is a right one  
A triple wrong is how I left  
Every joke is a sick one  
The devil quacked, and Jesus wept

Maybe you can pick the carcass cold  
I'll just be here  
Chasing bones and lights  
Till I flop through a noodle's eye  
Or hole up in the hay of high ideals

To gather in my life amess  
And braid a golden necklace.  
To turn my nose at childish things  
And braid the golden necklace
