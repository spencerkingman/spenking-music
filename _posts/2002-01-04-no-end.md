(by Low)  

`C F G`  
I couldn't wait to come back through  
To you  
`C F G`  
I thought I had so much to prove  
Untrue  
`C F G F G`    
I couldn't stand and leave you to  
Confused, the last screw  
That's cruel  
`C F G`  
Winding away the hours and days  
Unmade  
`C F G`  
Anticipating plans and ways  
To change  
`C F G F G`  
So many thing s that I can't take  
Away, It's today  
It's too late  
`C F G`  
`C F G`  
`C F G`  
Into the night and out again  
My friend is away  
`F D`  
With no end  
`F D`  
With no end, no end  
`F`  
no end  
`C F G`
