(We each wrote some verses. Only my verses are here.)  
  
Baby, stop the wiggle in my toe   
breath of holly angel in the snow  
stay a little prayer for who you know  
uncertainly, the wind, in forests blow  
  
Raffle old dominion, eye of tin   
life-and-death casino, are you in?  
a loser in the lottery of lead  
I always take the over on bloodshed   
  
'Cause underneath my glasses is my eyes  
and not to see a gangster short his guys  
would be t'all reality despise  
a shitheel from the shovel never shies  
  
Never will i think that you can tell time  
Never will i think that you can tell time
