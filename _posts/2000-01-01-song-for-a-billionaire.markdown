(by Geoffrey Leonard, Karly Parker, and I)  
(Only my verses are here)  
  
baby, stop the wiggle in my toe   
breath of holy angel in the snow  
say a little prayer for who you know  
uncertainly, the wind in forest blow  
  
raffle old dominion, eye of tin   
life-and-death casino, are you in?  
a loser in the lottery of lead  
I always bet the over on bloodshed   
  
'cause underneath my glasses is my eyes  
and not to see a gangster with his guys  
would be to all reality despise  
a shitheel from the shovel never shies  
  
never will i think that you can tell time
