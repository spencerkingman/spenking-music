(We each wrote some verses. Only my verses are here.)  
  
Baby, stop the wiggle in my toe   
breath of holly angel in the snow  
stay a little prayer for who you know  
uncertainly, the winds before us blow  
  
Raffle old dominion, hour of tin   
life-and-death casino, are you in?  
a loser in the lottery of lead  
I always take the over on tears shed   
  
'Cause underneath my glasses is my eyes  
and not to see a gangster short his guys  
would be t'all reality despise  
a shitheel to the shovel never flies  
  
(Never will i think that you can tell time)
