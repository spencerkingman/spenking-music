Why do I believe that I could be  
further from you than you from me?  
Family symmetries cut the line.  
    Settle them far from home.      
    Holograph on the bone of a clone.  
  
Why do I believe in what will grow?  
Cover up the window with the door.  
Careful, I'm not too sore to explore  
    So, come and land, u.f.o.      
    Aliens will lay me low  
    Let it go  
  
_My casino game is cards in the air_  
_Throw ‘em at a wall, and they’re everywhere_  
_Declarations fill the length of a shelf_  
_Rules are a game in and of themself_  
  
Crawl around the network on my face  
How to be alive and leave no trace?  
Perfect skin, check me in, hop the gate  
    CAPTCHAs on each arm  
    Tell 'em we mean no harm  
    To the farm  
  
Freer in anonymous domain  
Noone know address, abandon claim  
Look what came: empty box, sign your name  
    Radio signal chip  
    Nobody steals yr shit  
    I admit  
  
_Noble paper keeping tabs on a file_  
_Words gather up in a random pile_  
_Incantations of the law of the wild_  
_It's brass in the ears of a newborn child_  
  
Why do I believe that I could be  
further from you than you from me?  
Family symmetries cut the line.  
    Settle them far from home.      
    Holograph on the bone of a clone.
