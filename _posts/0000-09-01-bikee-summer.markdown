Now I go  
More miles than a car  
And the city, so suddenly small  
_(Life is so wonderful)_  
Post-industrial sprawl  
_(Go at your own pace)_  
  
Now I spend  
Less dough on a bus  
This machine a will of it's own  
I can't tell it "be done!"  
  
But the cars keep haning around  
Banging down, hanging over me  
  
Now I go  
More miles than a car  
_(Life is so wonderful)_  
_(Go at your own pace)_
