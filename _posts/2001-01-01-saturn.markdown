`Cmaj7 x35433 (x02100) Dm7`  
If there's another universe please make some noise  
Give me a sign; this can't be life  
`Cmaj7 Am7 Dm7 G7`  
If there's a point to losing love; Repeating pain  
It's all the same; I hate this place    

Stuck in this paradigm; don't believe in paradise  
This must be what Hell is like; there's got to be more, got to be more  
Sick of this head of mine; intrusive thoughts, they paralyze  
Nirvana's not as advertised; there's got to be more, been here before  

_(Ooh)_ Life's better on Saturn  
Got to break this pattern of floating away  
_(Ooh)_ Find something worth saving  
It's all for the taking; I always say  

`Cmaj7 Dm7 G`  
I'll be better on Saturn  
None of this matters  
Dreaming of Saturn, oh  

If karma's really real, how am I still here?  
Just seems so unfair; I could be wrong though  
If there's a point to being good then where's my reward?  
The good die young and poor; I gave it all I could  

Stuck in this terradome, all I see is terrible  
Making us hysterical; there's got to be more, got to be more  
Sick of this head of mine; intrusive thoughts, they paralyze  
Nirvana's not as advertised; there's got to be more, been here before  

_(Ooh)_ Life's better on Saturn  
Got to break this pattern of floating away  
_(Ooh)_ Find something worth saving  
It's all for the taking; I always say  

`Cmaj7 Dm7 G`  
I'll be better on Saturn  
None of this matters  
Dreaming of Saturn, oh

`Cmaj7 Dm7 G x2`    
_(Ooh)_  
_(Ooh)_
