<!-- [Capo on 4th Fret] -->

<!-- C#//// (add 3flat, high E string: x46660) -->

<!-- C#	                    G# -->
It's nothing to be / It's something / I'm not sided  
Oh, my Lord  

<!-- C#                         G# -->
Terra-cotta idols to piss on / whalebones  
Secrets are all I know  

<!-- C# / B / C# / B / -->

<!-- C#                        G# -->
Laugh and I will say: "How dare he make no sense!"  
<!-- C#                        G# -->
"F" it, I will say: "She's arrogant, arrogant, arrogant"  

<!-- A                            D                      Dmin add9 (x03230)         <----------- Arpeggios might work -->
The thing I won't protect you from  
is iron / We are  
really thin                                      

<!-- nicely in this part -->
<!-- ? (x0103x) -->
<!-- A                            D -->
But then she was allowed  
<!-- Bmin          E        -->
To swing her surgery around  
<!-- A                     F#min                    E -->
And wave it like a partisan for the Lord  

<!-- A   G# -->

Then we took our part  
in boiling metal, acid-yellow fun / cement on paint  
And moaning, incense, skin...  
I'm sinking in  

Mad at the year  

<!-- E5                           A5/E (x022xx)                        Amin(x322xx)    -->
The thing I won't protect you from  
is iron / We are  
really thin  
<!-- ? (X122XX) -->
<!-- G (320003)                           C (x32010) -->
<!-- But then she was allowed...   -->

<!-- G                            C -->

<!-- G                            C -->
But then she was allowed  
    <!-- Amin         D               G -->
To swing her surgery around  
                        <!-- Emin                        D -->
And wave it like a guard upon hallowed ground  
<!-- G     F#       B -->

Oh, what a sound
