(capo: 7)

`Em Bm A Em`
Everyone's tryin to decide  
Where to go when theres no place to hide  
I follow the bombs as theyre coming down  
This must have been hallowed ground

`G F Em G F E`  

No matter what they decide to have done  
Burn up the clouds. Block out the sun  
My hope is in one they cant bring down  
My soul is in hallowed ground

I see the fear. It's on the rise  
Lets catch the enemy by surprise  
Bury your treasure where it can't be found  
Bury it deep in hallowed ground
