I sent you the sun from my hometown  
And Chicago, and Atlanta  
Sinking at the sight of your shadow  
On the sidewalk in Spain  

Or back in Upstate, was it Jersey?  
At the airport to Alaska  
Sinking on a call from your hometown  
Where they found down, tearing through  

Flying through the blue on your old drive  
Got some old files, gotta find 'em  
Gotta get 'em out, gotta get out  
Gotta get good, gotta get  

Sinking in again, it's forever now  
Glad you held her, glad you held him  
Glad you helped me too, though I didn't know how  
To be closer to yo---u  

Shadowed by the blue, and the shining  
I am trying to shine, shine  

Hannah, do no harm  
Hannah, do no harm  
No harm, no harm, no, no  

Hannah, do no harm, no harm  
Hannah, do no harm  
No harm, no harm, no harm
