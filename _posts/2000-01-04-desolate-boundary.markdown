(capo: 2)

wandering, following  
waking up my calling  
it’s hot on your trail  
perforations in my veil  
  
where visions divide in me  
reservations slide free  
but still I mistake  
what I buy for what I break  
  
till paragraphs in bold fall out of me  
bastard and neanderthal  
warm hand to mouth, and it’s catch as catch can  
  
travellers pay tolls  
finality’s rolling like a fog of war  
but don’t cut a monument from that cloudwall's  
  
desolate boundary  
chase it up and down me  
confusions of state  
when your head is on the plate  
  
I don’t want to be leaderless  
have you never seen this?  
a hand’s empty skin  
blowing, tattered in the wind  
  
did parallels unwind and fall out of line,  
thirsty for a form divine?  
I found a formula for your headline  
  
desolation economies  
flip you for a pair of eyes  
and pluck the mountaintop off your hairline  
  
am I traveling alone?  
you can offer me a bed?  
you’ll take it off my price  
and lay it on my head  
  
errors of measurement  
riches of embarrassment  
its hand over fist  
cut your ankle at the wrist  
  
clap and disapparate  
come back with some passionate  
weight in your heels  
show a spider how it feels  
  
when parallels unwind and fall out of line  
thirsty for a form divine  
I found a formula for your headline  
  
but how can I make words? They're so opposite  
flailing like a hair of snakes  
all hot to harbor you in some raw space?
