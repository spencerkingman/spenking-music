`C/// G7`

Ever since we met the world's been upside down  
And if you don't stop troubling me you'll drive me out of town  
But if you go away as trouble ought to do  
Where will I find another soul to tell my trouble to?  
 
 
Then my bed is made of stone  
A star has burnt my eye  
I'm going down to the willow tree and teach her how to cry  
But if you go away as trouble ought to do  
Where will I find another soul to tell my trouble to?  
    
They bid me wear my hat  
Put on a nice new gown  
I tossed my bonnet over the roof and I guess it won't come down  
But if you go away as trouble ought to do  
Where will I find another soul to tell my trouble to?
