Two more miles  
I gotta go  
I gotta know  
Myself  
  
Two more hours  
Trapped in this car  
I'll never make it  
That far  
  
Stay with me  
Until he gets drunk  
And laughs like a rat  
  
Fold your head  
Into his arms  
  
Dressed for church  
It's the last place on Earth  
Last place on Earth  
You'd be caught in that shirt  
  
Pay for it  
He paid for your birth  
More than it's worth  
More than it's worth  
  
Stay with him   
Until he gives up  
  
Fold your head  
Into his arms  
  
Two more miles  
I gotta go  
I gotta know  
Myself  
  
Two more hours  
Trapped in this car  
I'll never make it  
I'll never make it  
  
Two more wives  
Ready to go  
They're not quite sure  
They're not quite sure
