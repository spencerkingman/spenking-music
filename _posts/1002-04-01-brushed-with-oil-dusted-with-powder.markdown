`E79 Esus E`  
Brushed with oil, dusted with powder  
`C G`  
The day began to decline  
`E79 Esus E`  
A broken door, hotel bedroom  
`C G`  
The sun cut in through the blind (oh but I tell you)  
`Dm C`  
The officer asked "how did it start?"  
`Em B7`  
Oh shit, "you know I wish I knew" I said  
`E F#m7 A E7`  
"On Highbury Fields, the Westside Highway  
`Cmaj7 G`  
Or here in the Hollywood hills"

In a black and white, to Orange County  
The sky was a beautiful blue  
A pack of lights 'n some keys they found there  
They wondered how much I knew (oh but I tell you)  
The officer asked "how did it start?"  
Oh shit, "you I wish I knew" I said  
"On Highbury Fields, the Westside Highway  
Or here in the Hollywood hills"

`D C G`  
And yes, it's over  
`D C G`  
And yes, oh the powerful have found me  
`A7`  
It was beautiful to see  
`Dmaj7`  
It was how I'm meant to be  
`D E G A`  
It was love, no matter what they say  
`F C`  
It's wonderful to be here

Abraham, my father, had a girl he called his angel  
I made my excuses and I like the way it feels  
The officer asked "how did it start?"  
Oh shit, "you I wish I knew" I said  
"On Highbury Fields, the Westside Highway  
Or here in the Hollywood hills"

And yes, it's over  
And yes, oh the powerful have found me  
It was beautiful to see  
It was how I'm meant to be  
It was love, no matter what they say  
It's wonderful to be here
