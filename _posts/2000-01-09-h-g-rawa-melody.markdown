Big plans for the morning  
Calling me out  
No signs for a warning  
Shone on your mouth  
  
Laid out my clothes before dawn  
Down on the damp of the lawn  
Face off with noone around  
No blinding angels surround  
  
Here, love in the hand  
Mine to give, here, mine to command  
  
Lay track on the garden  
Lay down in mud  
Don't ask for a pardon  
Dealt from above  
  
Fold on a line in the sand  
Warp till you really believe  
Carry some doubt in your hand  
Fate won't decide what you need for you  
  
If it's cash out and leave  
I've got mansions rolled up my sleeve  
  
Lead feet on the carpet  
Lighten my load  
Don't mock independence  
Out on the road  
  
Practice your beautiful show  
Tour where the car doesn't go  
All of your families are here  
So, Forward with nothing to fear   
  
For love in the clear  
Let good morning finally appear
