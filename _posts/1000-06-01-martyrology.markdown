    - Bad Blood, Good Blood

That's a lot of police  
I coughed an animal out  
Couldn't see shit, so I  
Held my breath and walked  
All the way to lost-and-shocked  
I'm all red   
   
Heavy in the lungs  
I peeled right over    
Doubled on the pavement  
Twist my shoulder  
Gasp hung    
My tomb stung    
Re-run  
   
Took a little milk into my eyeball  
Suddenly the wound hung back  
I tried to make some sense  
In my defense  
But nothing convincing  
   
That’s a lot of blood  
I choked the joke and spit  
Vomited a bomb now I'm    
Tryin' to get it off my lip  
Drop it in the bag and skip  
I can't talk  
   
River in a rock  
Don't scoop my cup  
Taste bloody in a whirlwind  
Spiraled up  
It's how close?  
I half-know  
It seems low  
   
Cities on the crush  
All vacuumed out  
Face body in the blush  
Don't touch that cloud  
It's sad luck  
We’re screwed shut  
And can't not know now  
  
That’s a lot of questions  
I don't guess what. I’m done  
Hooded with a bag and wire  
Searching with my tongue  
Tortured for information  
Got none  
  
Pyramid of men  
Float through that wall  
There's urine on the concrete floor  
We're all-important  
All hell-bent  
Spray paint  
  
Everybody's name on one big building  
Mirrors on the floor read backwards ceiling  
Hide out   
It’s white out  
Even at nightfall
