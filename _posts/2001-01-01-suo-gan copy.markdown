Sleep my baby, on my bosom  
Warm and cozy it will prove  
Round thee daddy's arms are folding  
In my heart a father's love  
  
There shall no one come to harm thee  
Naught shall ever break thy rest  
Sleep, my darling, babe, in quiet  
Sleep on daddy's gentle breast  
  
Sleep serenely, baby, slumber  
Lovely baby, gently sleep  
Tell me wherefore art thou smiling  
Smiling sweetly in thy sleep  
  
Does your sister smile upon thee  
When thy happy smile she sees  
Dost thou on her smile, while slumb'ring  
On my bosom peacefully  
  
Sleep my baby, on my bosom  
Warm and cozy it will prove  
Round thee mommy's arms are folding  
In her heart a mother's love  
  
There shall no one come to harm thee  
Nought shall ever break thy rest  
Sleep my darling, babe in quiet  
Sleep on mommy's gentle breast
