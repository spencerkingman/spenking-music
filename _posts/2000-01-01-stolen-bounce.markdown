`A(7) D Ab5`  
I had a date with a pretty ballerina  
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes  
I asked her for this dance, and then she obliged me  
`Em Dsus4`  
Was I surprised, yeah  
`G B7 (E)`  
Was I surprised, No not at all

you’ve been chewing through your pillow; I’m up late  
it’s having me for breakfast, shark bait

if one of us can’t both be wrong  
it’s awful off and hornery on  
cadavres learn their a-b-c  
so level x-ray eyes with me

when Saturn’s in my headroom, it’s a hard count  
rubber ring-toss, triple jump -- stolen bounce

stolen bounce  
cover, unannounced  
sleeping with the dogs  
turning in yr mouth

it’s nothing embarrassing  
what I’ve been imagining  
drop me like an egg on a trampoline  
better to sleep in the saddle than bleed an imaginary friend

vulnerability, stuck in the battery  
demons don’t come out automatically  
auto da fe, little mouse on a tray  
stand the table on its end

a fissure where my heartbeat saw through me  
can lovers undiscover their bodies?

if none of us can’t both be wrong...  
arms fall off, legs get long  
cadavres climb down family tree  
so wrestle x-ray eyes with me

we’ll bounce hammers off precarious boulder  
and roll away big Jesus shoulders

what are we ever gonna become?  
take another name  
speak another tongue

it’s nothing embarrassing  
but I’ve been imagining  
loading up on sea bands and dramamine  
better to sleep in the saddle than bleed an imaginary friend

vulnerability, sucking the battery  
spirits don’t come out automatically  
a crack in the egg, let the yolk run amok on the small of my back  
hard tack
