How much contempt  
can the melody hold?  
What depth of disdain  
for the moment, all told?   
Should the author decline  
to be nakedly known,  
how can I then in turn,   
take him on?  
  
I'll hear nothing more  
from the lie that they are;  
fussed-over hair  
and a face from the jar  
Did a murderers row  
run away with the throne?  
Will the seat of this woe   
stay unknown?   
  
Do I believe  
that a person like me  
has the leverage at hand  
to disturb any scene  
but the seat of my own  
rather comfortable life,  
with the world on the edge  
of a knife?
