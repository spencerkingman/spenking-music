tunnelling the narrow hollow  
gravel scrabble  
shovels scrap against the dull walls  
hammering round the hole  
no gold

hauling the eternal present  
through the moments  
backup stone-age weighs the cart down  
with feculent sacks of cans  
full hands

battle of inertias  
amoebal in the sinkhole  
feeble trample in the dump crunch  
what are we mining for?  
crude chore

solder in a cloudy vacuum  
milked-out diodes,  
slip-through photons, and blind loops  
rough halogen glyph descried  
eyes wide

a pebble in a pinhole  
combing down the haircrack  
thought, electric in a cold cave  
gravity misbehave  
roll, wave

has suddenly a morning window  
thrown me open  
to the forces of a wide room?  
has somebody split the veilâ€™s  
hot shell?

swimming in shallow orbit  
floating magnets  
spin around the room at full zoom  
gamma rays pass right through  
full moon

how am I going to get this piano to play cards with me?
