sin and innocence  
a sense of recompense  
this body isn't his  
no emergences  

I don't know who this is  
wrap his face up in cloth  

If I watch, flesh shadows flash on and off  
we'll all be fat-faced when more come  

hurry-home ride, windshield sun  
no dimension tonight  
the teenagers fight  
they carry candlelight  
in the open street  
with coffee, bed, and tea  
baby, come and see  

normal life is buried in this carnage garbage  
I never see a human form for all its bondage  
  
so come harm to me when it want  
I won't jump  
  
you get bored as hell living here  
and it makes you so cavalier  
can you find your way, heavy home  
with your senses all overthrown?  

--

who remembers who?  
purple, red, and blue  
put your glasses on  
a panorama view  

wave your silence there  
like a hand in the air  
not opressed by any big nothingness  
here's a postcard from the edge  

let it fill my eyes with everything  
that gluey color can prove  
then laser remove  

if nothing's permanent  
nothing's permitted  

not your body bare  
or covered up in here  

living cities break apart and float like nightboats  
this station's on an ocean with no shore to row to  
  
so come home to me when you want  
but not so blunt  
  
I pretend you're still living here  
and your lovely eyes do appear  
I pretend that you've been with me  
it exhausts all my energy
