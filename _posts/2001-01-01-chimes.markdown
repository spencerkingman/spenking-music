`Am C/G`  
`Am C/G G F(E)`

`Dm G Am F x2`  
`Am G`  

`Dm G Am E(7)`  
`F G F C`  

`end on Am`  

Oh, the chimes are sounding  
And they echo wildly off the canyon walls  
Well, this is wild land humming  
These are ancient songs that fill my body  

Oh, the light is astounding  
Its golden lashes sweep the old growth  
Well, this is my joy spiraling  
These are my spoils for simply breathing  

Still with all my faults  
I draw my breath from an ancient earth  

Oh, the light is astounding  
Like the sulfur cloud amongst these stately pines  
Well, I can hold my gaze as steady  
And in a thousand years we'd verily think the same  

Still with all my faults  
I draw my breath from an ancient earth  

Oh, for what it's worth  
I draw my breath from an ancient earth
