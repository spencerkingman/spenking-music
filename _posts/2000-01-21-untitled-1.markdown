What do I have to win  
In the window that I'm in?  
Picture and pretend,  
Or the matter to contend?  
  
Someone send me somewhere  
Lead me not astray  
Not too long ago   
Not too far away  
  
Whisper who you are  
Light a candle in my ear  
Traveling through the wall  
Am I anything all?  
  
Lain into the floor  
Like a hand against the wind  
Traveling black in time  
Fatalistic to no end
