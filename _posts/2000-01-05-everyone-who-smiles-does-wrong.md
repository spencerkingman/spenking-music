everyone who smiles does wrong  
if they do they want the car  
  
I can hear everything you say  
I'm gonna go deaf today  
  
guarantee to feel my wrath  
please don't feed the dogs fast food  
  
and don't build a wall  
I can see through you  
and after all  
what would it do?  
  
I've got walls enough, don't I  
  
I can hear everything you say  
I'm gonna go deaf today
