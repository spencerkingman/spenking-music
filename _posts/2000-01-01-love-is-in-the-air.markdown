(capo: 5)  
  
What do I have to win  
In the window that I'm in?  
Picture and pretend,  
Or the matter to contend?  
  
Someone send me somewhere  
Lead me not astray  
Not too long ago   
Not too far away  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

Whisper who you are  
Light a candle in my ear  
Thread by hanging wall  
Am I anything at all?  
  
Laid across the floor  
Like a hand against the wind  
Traveling black in time  
Hunger to no end  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

May I have this dance  
While our love is in the air?  
Filling the great expanse  
Brimming every moment spare  
  
If I am your someone  
Tell me how can this be then done?  
If you're someone's two  
How can this be then done to you?  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

Scaling the wall of life  
With a meaning to inscribe  
Read it from your age  
If a miracle survive  
  
Cup that runneth under  
Tessellations on the land  
Obsoleted map  
And I don't know where I am  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

Cultured as they come  
But at a loss for what to be  
Conspirators of remorse  
Tower over all I see  
  
Life is off in hiding  
Death is on parade  
Come out from his shadow  
Live beneath his blade  

<div style="height: 1rem;"></div>

What do I have to win  
In the window that I'm in?  
Picture and pretend,  
Or the matter to contend?  
  
Someone send me somewhere  
Lead me through the fray  
Not too long ago  
Not too far away
