Donald Canestraro's court filing  
Hand deep in the glove  
Dangerous liaison arrangements  
Under "the pile" and up above  
  
Did Omar al-Bayoumi drop  
A note on the restaurant floor?   
Recruit al-Hazmi and al-Midhar  
Into something more?   
  
No-showing at the no-show jobs  
Saudi embassy in touch  
Haifa bin Faisal's account funneled  
Payments from Bandar Bush  
  
Why hide it from the FBI?  
Tom Wilshire, Richard Blee  
Protecting network of agents  
From ALEC to GID  
  
Visas granted, passport chipped  
Sana'a, Kuala Lampur  
Why spike the memo and dangle  
the photos with names unlipped?  
  
Here comes that terrible rush  
Across the table again  
Out of commission, concussed   
All buried queries.  
Can none then truly know?  
  
Did a letter of introduction  
From the blind sheikh in a New York jail  
Place Ahmad Shah Massoud's assassins   
In Takhar with two days spare?  
  
Did rebels in the Yemen war leak  
The Tenet phone call  
To Ali Abdullah Saleh?   
"This is my personal  
  
Appeal. Release my man.  
Don't say his name on the phone."  
Same, that would later be killed  
Same, then a daughter and son  
  
Did Jessen resurrect his SERE training  
As a mindwipe regimen?   
Did Alfreda Francis Bikowsky  
Sit in on KSM's?  
  
Not to spy evidence out  
But seed a palimpsest in  
Backfill the casus belli  
With inadmissable din  
  
Did planners of the COG  
PNAC, clean break, Team B  
Big game safari, the hunt as  
A setup, the mammoths half-asleep?  
  
Does everywhere the finger points  
Come strategic defeat?  
Sorrows of empire, and woe to   
The conquered, the proxy,  
And the weak  
  
But weakness also redounds  
And dissipation runs clear  
No longer makers of facts  
No longer masters of fear
