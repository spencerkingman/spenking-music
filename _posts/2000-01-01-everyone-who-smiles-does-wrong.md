`xxx343            xxx121 xxx343`  
everyone who smiles does wrong  
if they do they want the car  
  
`xxx121                   xxx343`  
I can hear everything you say  
I'm gonna go deaf today  
  
guaranteed to feel my wrath  
please don't feed the dogs fast food  

`G Fm`   
and don't build a wall  
`xx0111 x1102x xx111x`  
I can see through you  
`D G`  
and after all  
`Bbm7 Eb7 (Eb6)`  
what would it do?  

`C Gm C`  
I've got walls enough, don't I?  
walls and bags enough, woah nigh  

`Bb C`  
I can hear everything you say  
I'm gonna go deaf today
