I'm full of horror! you should calm me down!   
The gold-in-black is not a lost book found!   
Red-marker passage on the saint-haunt song book:   
"Don't mix the bad blood with the good blood!"   

Possessed and settled on a price less lost   
No porous borders where the wire-skulls crossed   
rake out the pattern with a broke-branch whip   
we let the lines drop where the branch dipped

The war is over: Duty arms string down   
Pool out the trophy hats, and bite gold crowns   
Shake out the carpet when the scalps go rot   
I pulled the knot tight and got my hair caught   

I'm rollin' over with my tongue flared out   
To shake the stubble off my talk-sick mouth   
Scratch-off love; you let your legs lay fat   
I took a hot bath after the blood bath   

I'm out of glory; could you smoke me out?  
Deep-coma pass-out on your slashed-up couch  
Woke up with ketchup on my pants and face!  
Who brought the bad the bad blood? I want some good blood.  

I'm full of horror; you should mind your own   
my camouflage is white as bone!    
my color memory is a western rust    
it sees a deathwish behind the bloodlust
