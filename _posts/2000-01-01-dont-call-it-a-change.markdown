In the last second of the year of the Earth  
A charnel house captured in a layer of dirt  
It wasn't a volcano or the continental shelf  
We're buried in a crater that we dug upon ourselves  
Why sing about anything else?  
  
When You're going extinct  
Don't call it a change  
You're going extinct  
Don't call it a change  
Don't call it a climate change  
   
2 degrees is holding like a Maginot wall  
In Fahrenheit its 4 degrees, but that's overall  
The air over the water doesn't warm as fast as land  
One day we're gonna wake up on an unfamiliar planet  
  
I was taught recycling is what I can do  
And so I pay attention to the white and the blue  
But why should I obsess? I'm not a martyr or a saint  
And the symbol with the arrows isn't at all what you think  
  
For 50 years refrigerants and aerosol sprays  
And chloro-flouro-carbons were a beautiful way  
By accident a station found a hole up in the sky  
But if Dupont had chosen bromine, then our ass would be fried  
Why sing about anything else?  
  
Don't call it a change  
You're going extinct  
Don't call it a change  
Don't call it a climate change  
  
A genocide is crawling on the face of the land  
It's blowing in the wind, ice, fire, water, and sand  
Who can raise a crop? Who can raise a sail?  
Europe is a fortress, and America's a jail  
  
The average little foot is over 4 metric tons  
But in America it's 20: oil, money and guns  
Even off the grid you'd still be pushing 8 or 9  
It's enough to make you cynical, but now is not the time  
  
There's twenty trillion dollars in the offshore accounts  
How much would it cost to put the carbon underground?  
You can suck it from the air and fuse it with basalt  
I don't want to die with all this money in a vault  
Or why not plant a shit-ton of trees?  
  
We're going extinct  
Don't call it a change  
We're going extinct  
Don't call it a change  
Don't call it a climate change  
  
Is it easier to see the end of all living things  
Then to take over the market and the chaos it brings?  
We only have have each other so each other we must save  
And not just one by one, but all together in a wave  
And why sing about anything else?
