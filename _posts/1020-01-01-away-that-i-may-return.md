Away, that I may return, alien  
Through this flaming door  
A man, no more protected from the elements  
Burn the core away to hold in sway

The sea, the wall  
Least of these, most of all  
Let sweet light sweep in  
The wall's so thin  
Any line against the immigrant wind  
Can scarce contain a sky of rain

A mouthful of this barbed wire can only detain a word  
So long as it's fire's kept alive, and it's ransom's heard

I've been on this journey  
I need another home  
It's a storm where I'm from  
And a storm where I'm going

The state of a man on the move  
Is never what it should  
But I'll be your foot on the ground  
Till everything is good

Come out, get in  
Outside-in and out again  
Through this flaming door  
A man, no more coherently inhabiting  
My remembered place. It's half-erased.

But a desert full of bone men can only detain a word  
So long as their ire's kept alive and their ransom heard

I've been on this journey  
I need another home  
There's a storm where I'm from  
And a storm where I'm going

The state of a man on the move  
Is never what it should  
But I'll be a foot on the ground  
Till everything is good  
And I'll be your foot on the ground  
Till everything is right  
For now, I'm walking the line  
And keeping out of sight
