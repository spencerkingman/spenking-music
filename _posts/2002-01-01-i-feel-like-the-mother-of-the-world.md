`F#   E   B`  
Whether or not there is any type of God  
I'm not supposed to say  
And today I don't really care  
God is a word and the argument ends there  

Oh, do I feel like the mother of the world  
Oh, do I feel like the mother of the world  
With two children  
Oh, do I feel like the mother of the world  
With two children, fighting  

`B   F#`  
When I was a boy,  
I used to get into it bad with my sister.  
And when the time came to face the truth  
There'd only be tears and sides, tears and sides  
And my mother, my poor mother would say  
It does not matter, it does not matter, just stop fighting  

`F#   E   B`  
Oh, do I feel like the mother of the world  
Oh, do I feel like the mother of the world  
Oh, do I feel like the mother of the world  
With two children
