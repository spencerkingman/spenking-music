(by Woody Guthrie, Klezmatics)  
(capo: blue 1)

Oh, will you come when I call you?  
I’ll come when you call me.  
I’ll call you half-past ten.  
Ten for the atom bomb loose again.  
Nine for the crippled and blind.  
Eight for my eight billion graves.  
Seven for continents blowed up.  
Six for the cities all wrecked.  
Five's for these warplanes that fly.  
Four's for the guns of this war.  
Three’s for these warships at sea.  
Two's for the love of me and you.  
One's for the pretty little baby  
that’s born, born, born and gone away.
