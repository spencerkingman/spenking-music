hot for a day, ok  
sparks on a lid  
lines in the clay  
  
get yourself arrested, what's the use?  
they got cameras on the roof  
if you want to see the truth  
you've got to drop it from the roof  
  
home and your omen's good  
rocks in the ark  
bumps in the wood  
  
shaken by a tremor on the calm  
don't know what to tell my mom  
in a thousand years, if I'm   
still in a coffin, drop the bomb  
  
I caught my eyes on a brand new magazine  
  
burn up in the sun’s false light  
bright purple rays  
clouds in a fight  
  
you don't have to travel far away  
dodging bullets for a day   
get in near to see it clear  
you’re still another world away  
  
wake up on a harp string's thumb  
play metal rings  
bang on a drum  
  
terrorize the party from within   
you'll be welcomed as a friend  
then get caught up in some shit   
that doesn't matter in the end    
  
I cut my eyes on a brand new magazine  
don't ask me where my mind has been
