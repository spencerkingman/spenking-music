I was in a brotherhood of man  
don't remind me  
cancer grew on everything he said  
it grows on, it goes on  
  
I was in a brotherhood of men  
but it's all behind me  
don't get me back into it again  
it's all gone, I'm so done  
  
blow bubble down by  
hold my spikes in  
lie, little eye, lie still  
thugs won't jump me in, no  

hide me at work times  
sleep by, week by  
pay double, pay diamond  
so I can take every one that's on the island  
  
now I'm in the brotherhood again  
and so divine me  
but if you come around, I'm out of town  
ding-dong, I'm long gone  
  
I went undercover with a shout  
gagged and blind, me  
scrape another scalp and shake it out  
fake drugs, no doubt  

blow bubble down by  
hold my spikes in  
lie, little eye, lie still  
drugs won't jump me in, no-no
  
hide me at work times  
sleep eye, weep eye  
pay devil, pay diamond  
so I can take every one that's on the island
