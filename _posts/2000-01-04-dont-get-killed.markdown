I sleep at dusk, and I wake at dawn.  
I see a fire from the roof I’m on.  
Who could we punish?  
I know they’ve done this  
just to set me off.  
  
But I jumped out of the sea.  
So get these wet clothes off of me.  
Into a furnace; it doesn’t burn us.  
Let’s go find that dog,  
and bark the roll call out  
all around the block.  
  
I’m breathing metal in the devil’s eyes.  
I’ve seen a photo where they’ve got these guys  
tied up and naked. I couldn’t take it.  
Laid right down and died.  
I’m busting out worldwide.  
Call it what you like.
