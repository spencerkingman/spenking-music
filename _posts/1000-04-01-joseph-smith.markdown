My God, young lord  
I saw it with my eyes  
My God, how long?  
To take into these hands  
These years can only expand  
<span style="margin-left:2rem;">like dough</span>  
I buried them in snow  

My God, young lord  
What did I ever know?  
I can't go back now  
Everyone's so old  
But I can never be old  
I cast my face in gold  

Ooh, how it rolled  
Down my face  
And off my clothes  

I got struck dumb  
And frozen to my spot  
My eyes felt black  
My face was very hot  
Every cell in my skin  
<span style="margin-left:2rem;">got stuck</span>  
I gave my body up
