Garden of evil days  
I don't know how I'm gonna grow in you  
Fountain of bitterness  
Seed of malevolence  
The fingers of violence  
In a garden of evil days  
  
What is my life in this cauldron of being?  
What can see me through the stir of years?  
When anything can disappear  
Anyone can have their stem cut  
I draw upon the morning’s breath  
But who can piece together any living reason?  
  
Garden of evil days  
I don't know how I'm gonna go in you  
Laughter and weightlessness  
A flower of innocence  
Caught out in the poisonous  
Wind, wind, wind  
In a garden of evil days  
  
Are shadows effacing the sundial?  
A growling sky out on the loose  
I’ll shelter in place while I ride out  
Another hundred years’ storm, the second one this summer  
  
In a garden of evil days  
I don't know how I'm gonna show in you  
Apocalypse, now and then  
It's never again, again  
The devil's a right to know  
When, when, when  
In a garden of evil days
