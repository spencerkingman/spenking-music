mortified  
sing your life  
it's ok  
sell your sides  
you're mortified  
  
and blessed to death  
they'll stretch your neck  
to fit the crime  
and test your weight   
against a sealed escape  
  
you're getting weak  
the futures speak   
your past and prime  
is crashing in upon   
the walls so thin  
  
the stranglehold  
he wizened so old   
in a courtroom shell  
pretend to move  
condemned to hell  
  
western lecture  
make sure that she   
says my name  
it's in her book  
it's the shameless crook  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
mortified  
sing your life  
it's ok  
sell your sides  
you're mortified  
you're mortified
