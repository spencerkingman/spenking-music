Gotta build your rock on the Ray-O-Vac  
Gotta build your rock on the Ray-O-Vac  
on the Ray-O-Vac

You believe in cotton candy  
And you are not lying  
Your brother and his friends are living   
in a dying border town  
Where getting out means running away  
And getting crossed means going down  
They just suck hard and they choke it back  
Now how can you bust up and act like that?  
  
Gotta build your rock on the Ray-O-Vac  
Gotta build your rock on the Ray-O-Vac  
on the Ray-O-Vac  
on the Ray-O-Vac  
  
When I was 12  
And my ass was up for grabs  
The kids at school had their  
Religion, sex, and greed  
Something was wrong with them  
How could any kid know what was going wrong?  
They just suck hard and they choke it back  
Now how can you bust up and act like that?  
  
Gotta build your rock on the Ray-O-Vac  
Gotta build your rock on the Ray-O-Vac  
on the Ray-O-Vac  
on the Ray-O-Vac  
Gotta build your rock on the Ray-O-Vac
