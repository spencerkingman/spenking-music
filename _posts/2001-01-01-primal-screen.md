(capo: 4)

A primal screen  
I can't look at it  
Awful, what's occurred  
Jesus has no shirt  
Or words to spell on me  
While sewers of requirement  
Overflow high reservoir

Atom blasted poem  
Devastation rhyme  
Seraphim leaving the EARTH like it's over  
A fever incandescent  
And everyone inert  
The tesseracts haven't a clue who to comfort.

A hollow horn  
For dead and born  
A wind across our gate  
For staying out too late  
To clear the pickled air  
In a pyramid so useless  
That I don't even come alive!

In palaces and shitholes  
We're fitted out for what?  
To carry this raggedy torch  
across the dry brush?  
To barricade the ocean?  
To look out past the sun?

_For somewhere to run... all there, or none_  
_Into a void... all there, or none_  
_To do and be done... all there, or none_

So, goeth not  
To this ground  
Though all the air is wired  
Apple of my eye  
Overloaded child  
Can you look into the hue and cry  
And see it with your planet eyes?

Chasm blasted poem  
Devastation line  
Seraphim leaving the EARTH like it's over.  
A fever incandescent  
And resurrection gore  
The tesseracts haven't a clue who to come for
