you’ve been chewing through your pillows; I’m up late  
it’s having me for breakfast, shark bait  
  
if one of us can’t both be wrong  
it’s awful off and hornery on  
cadavres learn their a-b-c  
so level x-ray eyes with me  
  
when Saturn’s in my headroom, it’s a hard count  
rubber ring-toss, triple jump --  stolen bounce  
  
stolen bounce  
cover, unannounced   
sleeping with the dogs  
turning in yr mouth  
  
it’s nothing embarrassing  
what I’ve been imagining  
drop me like  an egg on a trampoline  
better to sleep in the saddle than bleed an imaginary friend  
  
vulnerability, stuck in the battery  
demons don’t come out automatically  
auto da fe, little mouse on a tray  
stand the table on its end  
  
a fissure where my heartbeat saw through me  
can lovers undiscover their bodies?  
  
if none of us can’t both be wrong...  
arms fall off,  legs get long  
cadavres climb down family tree  
so wrestle x-ray eyes with me  
  
we’ll bounce hammers off precarious boulder  
and roll away big Jesus shoulders  
  
what are we ever gonna become?  
take another name  
speak another tongue  
  
it’s nothing embarrassing  
but I’ve been imagining  
loading up on sea bands and dramamine  
better to sleep in the saddle than bleed an imaginary friend  
  
vulnerability, sucking the battery  
spirits don’t come out automatically  
a crack in the egg, let the yolk run amok on the small of my back  
  
hard tack
