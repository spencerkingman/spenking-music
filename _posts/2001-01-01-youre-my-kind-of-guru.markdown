I heard about the helicopters  
`Em Em9`  
Should've been a warning sign  
A fleet of rollers  
A Bentley too  
Seems to me a reasonable point of view  

`Am D G Bb Am D E7`  
You're my kind of guru  
Yeah you  
Did you poison the water too?  
My kind of guru  
Yeah you
Yeah you  

`Am D G Bb Am D E7`  
I'm the bloody red baron for you  
I'm a Sopwith Camel for you  
You're my field in France  
I can't count on you  
I'm comin' in at a low altitude

You're my kind of guru  
On the ground  
The bombers view  
Japanese soldiers still fighting World War II  

You're my kind of guru  
Yeah you  
Did you poison the water too?  
My kind of guru  
Yeah you
Yeah you
