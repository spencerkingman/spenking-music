Sleeping in a Caterpillar tractor  
In the middle of a parking lot a graveyard  
IDF surround you  
They've got every right to pound you  
So you slip off through the vineyard  
  
Jesus, Mary, Joseph
Light a candle on the mantle  
Dip your hand inside a cradle  
Prove to me a family  
Test my manhood  
I'm a batter for the California Angels  
Putting food up on the table  

How could it be so?  
How could it be so?  

Take a look a can of coke  
Pour some cake into the hole  
Throw it at the head of state  
Cancel all his dinner dates  
You think you're from Palestine  
You're from Vegas every time  

How could it be so?  
How could it be so?  

Belly, girl, I missed you  
How come you never even kiss me?  
Cause I'd itch and have to shower  
I was blinded by a weapon that they made for Armageddon  
Lick your paws and put 'em on me  
So I don't become a zombie
