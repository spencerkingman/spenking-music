What do I have to win  
In the window that I'm in?  
Picture and pretend,  
Or the matter to contend?

Someone send me somewhere  
Lead me not astray  
Not too long ago  
Not too far away

Whisper in the dark
Light a candle in my ear  
Armored wall-on-wall
Are we anything at all?

Splayed across the floor  
Like a hand against the wind  
Traveling black in time  
Fatalistic to no end

May I have this dance
While our love is in the air?
Filling the great expanse
Thunder in our hands
