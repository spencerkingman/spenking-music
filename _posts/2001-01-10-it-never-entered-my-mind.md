(Rogers and Hart, John Lewis)

`G/B  D  G/B  D`  
I don't care if there's powder on my nose  
`G/B  D  G/B  D`  
I don't care if my hairdo is in place  
`G/B  D                A4  E7`  
I've lost the very meaning of repose  
`(G6)  A    E/B             C   C(b5)(x3455x)`  
I never put a mudpack on my face  
`Edim(x7898x)                   C(#11)(x32012)`  
Oh, who'd have thought that I'd walk in a daze now?  
`Baug(x2100x)                              E7`  
I never go to shows at night, just to matinees now  
`A4     A`  
I see the show  
`Am7   Adom6(x03200)`  
And home I go

Once I laughed when I heard you saying  
That I'd be playing solitaire  
Uneasy in my easy chair  
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken  
That I'd awaken with the sun  
And order orange juice for one  
It never entered my mind

`G6          A9           Dmaj7         (Em7)`  
You had what I lack, myself  
`Dmaj7 G6   A6      Bdim       A9      F#m7 Daug(xxx332)`  
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me,  
I'd say the maiden's prayer again  
`Am   Adim`  
And wish that you were there again  
`G6 A6 F#7b9 B7`  
To get into my hair again  
`G6 A6 Bbdim Bm`  
It never entered my mind  
`G6 A6 D6maj7(x07677)`  
It never entered my mind
