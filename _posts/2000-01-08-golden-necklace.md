Pick any bone of contention  
The chicken's split into two sides  
Every wish that I make now   
Feels like gambling in disguise  
I only sing on the pay phone  
There's lucky quarters in my shoe  
Are you addicted to pig slop?  
Oh ho ho, me too  
  
Maybe you can kick the habit cold  
I'll just be here  
Chasing bones and lights   
Till I drop through a noodle's eye  
Or hole up in the hay of high ideals  
  
To see if I can't wake up  
From this graceless, burning slumber.  
The number on my baseball card  
Is not a baseball number.  
  
Its a Marianas Trench  
A tub-o-lard in a sea of pitch   
Angels in the outhouse with the moon door  
  
Where mares eat oats, and does eat oats,  
And little lambs eat ivy  
Everyone's so scared to hear your prayers   
But why should I be?  
  
All alone in my old heart  
Too, alive, but the scattered parts  
Can never seem to manifest whole hog  
  
To gather up a life amess  
And braid a golden necklace.  
To turn my nose at childish things  
And braid the golden necklace  
  
Should a feast fall in the lap?   
Go to town in the butterfat  
I'll forage in the forest for a salt lick  
  
Cause very song is a love song  
A "me and you" or "you and I"   
Every show is a cop show  
A Law and order, csi  
Every turn is a right one  
A triple wrong is how I left  
Every joke is a sick one  
The devil quacked and Jesus wept  
  
Maybe you can pick the carcass cold  
I'll just be here  
Chasing bones and lights   
Till I drop through a noodle's eye  
Or hole up in the hay of high ideals  
  
To see if I can't wake up  
From this graceless, burning sunburn.  
The number on my baseball card  
Is not a baseball number.  
  
Its a Marianas Trench  
A tub-o-lard in a sea of pitch   
Angels in the outhouse with the moon door
