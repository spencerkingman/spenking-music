here we are, we are no more  
deserving than you are  
of a bed behind the cows  
or china on the walls

peel it off  
something isn't right  
tremble at the sight  
of a crowd in the yard late at night

a ball of ice divides the house  
with fires around the couch  
bodies ache and lay awake  
no matter what they take

cough it up  
rattle round the sink  
bubbles in the drink flatten up  
has your wife had enough?

we came here from Sweden  
in search of a job  
we know it will be hard  
wherever we are

as you may, we may, remain  
impossible to shame  
you, because youâ€™ve seen it all  
and me, because I can...

look away  
any given way  
who would want to stay  
catching hell to pay?

on the log, they need a dog  
to serve and to protect  
they could offer me the boots  
but why would I accept?

I expect  
more than I have seen  
floating on a screen  
to appear, doubting eyes  
to appear, as a prize,  
to appear
